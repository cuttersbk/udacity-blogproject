                <p> 
                  WOWEE. July was a good month! I started it off with 4th of July in Santa Cruz
                  and I got to see Sean! We went surfing, had dinner on the beach, and went to 
                  the boardwalk and rode the rollercoaster there. I am definiely happy to be 
                  moving there in the fall! <br> Alas my time there had to come to an end and I had to fly back to Seattle and
                  get back to life at Mt. Rainier. My research is going rather well but Jessie, 
                  my research partner is leaving August 9th and then I will have to wrap up the 
                  study on my own before I head out October 11th.<br>
                  My parents and brother came up to see me and we spent a night at the Gobblers Knob 
                  firelook out in the far west of the park. It was gorgeous and I took so many pictures. <br>
                  After that though is was back to work! We did SO much field work this month, 8-10 hour days 
                  in the field and I'm ready for some office days in front of a computer. <br>
                  Sorry this is such a short post but here's some photos to make up for it!

              My name is Shelby Cutter, and I am a Imminent Threat Technician Intern at Mt. Rainier National Park.
              I graduated from Whitman College in May and plan on moving to Santa Cruz in November. 
              I majored in Geology when at Whitman and that is what I hope to do as a career. I am also interested
               in coding, which is why I created this blog from scratch. <br>
