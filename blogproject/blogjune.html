              <p> 
                My first month at Mt. Rainier all done! Lots of getting situatied in Longmire, WA.
                Longmire is a "town" within the park where most of the seasonal employees live.
                There is no grocery store, no bars, no nothing except for my office and my house.
                My house that has no cell service or wifi. I'm going to be spending alot of time in the 
                office downloading shows on Netflix and Amazon Prime. I currently have a room to 
                myself, and then two other housemates, Jessie and Emma. I know I will have a roommate but 
                she won't be getting here for another few weeks. <br>
                The whole grocery store being far away is really rough, I'm going to be racking up a 
                lot of bills in gas money that's for sure. <br>
                It's hard to believe I'll be here for five months but I'm excited for the adventure
                and I'll be trying my hardest to update this once a month, or more if I can! <br>
                I will see y'all in the next one!

            My name is Shelby Cutter, and I am a Imminent Threat Technician Intern at Mt. Rainier National Park.
            I graduated from Whitman College in May and plan on moving to Santa Cruz in November. 
            I majored in Geology when at Whitman and that is what I hope to do as a career. I am also interested
             in coding, which is why I created this blog from scratch. <br>
